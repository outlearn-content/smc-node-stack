# Node Style Guide


We based our node coding styles on the following guide from Felix Geisend√∂rfer on GitHub.

# Node Deployment Primer

Our Node apps are deployed to Heroku.  Their documentation is very helpful.


<!-- @resource, "url" : "https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction", "forceBasic": true, "imageUrl": "http://cl.ly/3E0W2j13132T/heroku-logo.jpg" -->

> Note: a local copy of the `.env` file required for passwords and access.  You can download that from the [Secure Wiki Docs](http://www.supermegacorp.com/wiki/secure) site.

Now simply install our `deploy-tools` npm library.

```bash
nvm use 4.2.4
nvm alias default 4.2.4
npm install supermegacorp/deploy-tools
```

From there, you can deploy the smc-hello-world app to test your configuration.

```bash
cd smc-hello-world
heroku create
git push heroku master
```

Reach out to your assigned Mentor if you have any problems with this task that you can't debug.

# Node Services Architecture

Our microservices architecture was heavily inspired by this YouTube video from StrongLoop.

You can find our internal API documentation for all our microservices on the API docs pages.
